# Countries - Swift App

A simple Swift application developed with UIKit, WebKit, and Safari Services frameworks to show a list of countries, add them to a saved list, and view details of countries. It uses [GeoDB Cities API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities
) as the data source.

## General Information
The Countries application is a simple application where users can view a list of countries, save the country, and read the details of it.

The project was written using Swift programming language. Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. The app is only compatible with iOS which means it can only run on iPhones. I used Xcode IDE for creating the app.
